## Screenshots

![Sort function ](https://github.com/mandeep9888/bcdv4028_lab1/blob/7ac94ae5affc5b1ffa9c186b0b68c59c53305df3/sortArry_lib.png)

here you can see sortArray function implemented as part of the library implementation 

![Remove Duplicate function ](https://github.com/mandeep9888/bcdv4028_lab1/blob/7ac94ae5affc5b1ffa9c186b0b68c59c53305df3/removeDupArray.png)

here you can see removeDuplicate function implemented as part of the library implementation 


![Contract Code ](https://github.com/mandeep9888/bcdv4028_lab1/blob/7ac94ae5affc5b1ffa9c186b0b68c59c53305df3/contract_sort_removeDuplicate_functions.png)

As part of this contract, we are initiating an original array on which we going to perform the operations defined in the library above.


![sort and unique array outputs ](https://github.com/mandeep9888/bcdv4028_lab1/blob/7ac94ae5affc5b1ffa9c186b0b68c59c53305df3/sort_unique_outputs.png)

as you can see we have sorted array and unique array as part of the decoded output

## Lab 2

![Contract Code check ](https://github.com/mandeep9888/bcdv4028_lab1/blob/49f6bf5dde22903d20c3e4bfc10961f7c2e32bb3/contract_codecheck.png)

As part of this contract, we are checking if address has code associated with it on not. If its a EOA there wont be any code associated with it, but we will have Code associated with contract address, As you can see we passed an contract address and function is return true.

![EOA Code check ](https://github.com/mandeep9888/bcdv4028_lab1/blob/49f6bf5dde22903d20c3e4bfc10961f7c2e32bb3/EOA_codecheck.png)

EOA address is passed and function is returning false in this case
